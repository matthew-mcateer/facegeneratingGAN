* Configuration
* The helper.py and unittests.py files are dependencies that should also be included in the directory
* Unit tests are set up to automatically be run by the python notebook before the running of the Genrative Adversarial Network.
* To start, run the Jupyter Notebook application in an environment (such as that created by Anaconda) for
